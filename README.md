##Vulkan Boids
Vulkan in Khronos Group's new explicit API powering the latest generation of games. One of the interesting new features of the Vulkan API is that it provides an interface to do compute work as well as graphics. Siultaneous graphics and compute workloads is becoming increasingly important; it is believed that this is one of the main advantages held by AMD Radeon GPUs over the latest generation NVIDIA GPUs (Pascal). 

In this project, I run display the power of side-by-side graphics and compute with a very simple Boid flocking re-implementation. This is the same algorithm as that implemented in [Project 1](https://github.com/gabenaghi/Project1-CUDA-Flocking), except in 2D.
